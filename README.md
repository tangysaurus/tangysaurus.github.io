Built a conversational AI coach using Vapi and Google Gemini that generates personalized workout plans tailored to user goals, health conditions, and available equipment, achieving less than 1 second latency.

## Stat 20 AI Tutor
[GitHub](https://github.com/tangysaurus/stat-20-tutor)  
AI chatbot agent that helps students study for Stat 20 more effectively. 
Implemented using GraphRAG, which involves using an LLM and Neo4j graph database to create a knowledge graph of course material from UC Berkeley's [Stat 20 online textbook](https://stat20.berkeley.edu/summer-2025/notes.html). When a student asks a question, the agent searches through the knowledge graph to retrieve context, which gets fed to an LLM to generate a response. Uses WolramAlpha's API for mathematical tool calling and OpenAI o4-mini for LLM support.
